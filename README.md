# Quality Enhancement of written document using deep learning models
In this project a U-Net based model was designed to produce high quality images of written documents. The input of this model is a low quality image of documents with multiple defects, such as images containing hand or visualizerâ€™s shadow, bad lightning, over-exposure and so on. The input is also in low quality, so in addition to omitting the defects the model should increase the quality of the documents.

In the end we reached a trained model with an accuracy of 98 percent which is a very good result considering the challenges we faced in this problem.
